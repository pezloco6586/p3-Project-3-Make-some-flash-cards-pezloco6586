Once the user gets each function right three times in a row of it being shown sporadically, the concept will be shown half as much.
If the computer is able to identify the answer when the value is input incorrectly as an answer for something else, the addition to the response "that answer is incorrect" will be something like this:

say the given is sin(pi/6) and user says "root3/2", the computer could respond either with "that answer is incorrect. you might be thinking of the cosine of that radian!"
